This is a C++ program that simulates a Stone, Paper, Scissors game where a player competes against the computer. The game follows standard rules:  

- Stone beats Scissors  
- Scissors beat Paper  
- Paper beats Stone  

The player selects their choice, while the computer generates its choice randomly. Each round determines
a winner based on the rules, and the game keeps track of the scores. After all rounds are completed, 
the program displays the final result, announcing the overall winner or if itâ€™s a tie.

## the code 
i wrote the code in 1 day (my own version) but I deleted careless of me 
My version worked but was not as efficient as the model code.
